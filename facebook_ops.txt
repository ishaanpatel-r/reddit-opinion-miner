Facebook suspended myPersonality from its platform on 7 April saying the app may have violated its policies due to the language used in the app and on its website to describe how data is shared.

Fun, another example of ineptness by a personality quiz that people will just end up seeing as "facebook leaks everyone's data" even though that's not at all what happened. It's a shame people don't actually read articles
Eh no one cares, seriously. Not even when ol' snowden revealed the data collection a few years back did people give a shit. People will still use facebook regardless so the general apathy of the world will never change in regards to data privacy.
I have never had a facebook account and never will, but that commercial still enrages me. 
Lol didn’t Facebook seriously ask for our nudes not too long ago?

Nobody read anything and think it's directly facebook themselves instead of a third party.

People answered on some shitty third party quizz on facebook....
Yup, I agree with all of that. On a personal level, besides voting, all I can really do though is stop using their services and hope others do so as well to help send a message to whatever the "next facebook" is. 
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/ireland-abortion-campaign-foreign-influence-facebook) reduced by 86%. (I'm a bot)

But I just saw a commercial where facebook told me they are changing and are good hearted and would never do anything to hurt me baby.

You joke, but US police have previously [jailed a guy for a joke in facebook chat](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180221/10310339276/five-years-after-his-arrest-prosecutors-try-to-push-back-justin-carters-terroristic-threat-trial.shtml)

A man who [called politicians corrupt and US police threw him in jail](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/27/586564094/the-curious-case-of-a-florida-man-who-called-politicians-corrupt-got-thrown-in-j)

And my personal favourite, after the [Dallas shootings, police arrested citizens who criticized the cops on facebook on twitter](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/12/after-dallas-shootings-police-arrest-people-for-criticizing-cops-on-facebook-and-twitter/)
Do you know what really grinds my gears about all this facebook fucking insanity?  People like Ted cruz had the audacity to question zuckerberg about privacy but is the same dude who voted to allow ISP to sell our fucking browser history.  So it was wrong for facebook but, yeah,  Verizon can collect information about us and sell it to the highest bidder?  NO fuck you, this shit is crazy.  

This is so asinine.  What happened with facebook is horrible but for fucks sake people,  They aren't the only ones that are destroying our privacy.

Is facebook one of those apps? 
facebook is a cancer on society but its dumb to hold this against them. they obviously don't encourage this sort of thing. they just can't and shouldn't police how people use the platform.

-

besides if you are going to chastise them for this sort of thing you also have to praise them for all the positive connections they are allowing people to make too.
Nah man. The way facebook works, somebody reports it and they do jack shit about it. Maybe now, as it is leaked to the media. You always need that extra pressure or a lawyer.

I've reported illegal activity to reddit and they didn't do shit either.
i mean i can't count the number of times i've reported someone on facebook for posting porn on my timeline and facebook coming back and saying "nothing is wrong here move along." they don't give enough of a shit to begin with.
I just read the article and all it talks about are the same old tired, rehashed arguments that officials use to try to pin every bad thing that bad people do on the website they use. They mentioned Zuck's congressional hearing and portrayed him as a straight-up liar because he said he wasn't aware of the illegal trafficking pages they reported...as if every time you flag a post Zuckerburg manually reviews it and commits it to memory himself. Then they talked about how Facebook DARED to post ads next to animal parts, again, as if a human was looking at this terrible stuff and made an informed decision that, "Yes, this is where this Viagra ad should go...right here next to the tiger cub paws."


I think the most salient point of the article is this:

>His investigator found wildlife traffickers on Facebook and infiltrated their crime syndicate. Within days, they met face-to-face and offered to purchase more than 4,000 pounds of ivory valued at nearly $1.5 million.

Not only is it easier for bad guys to find each other, it is also easier for the good guys to find the bad guys. A little bit of facebooking and it led to a huge bust (depending if they worked with law enforcement I guess)! 


Here's an analogy: There's a guy standing on a street corner. He knows the neighborhood pretty well, and if anyone asks him for an address he can give them the directions. He's pretty thick though, so he can't really determine that "Pedophile Greg's house" is a bad place to send people. On the flip side though, if the cops come by and ask where Pedo Greg is hanging out these days, dude will tell them exactly where to go to arrest him...it works both ways. The argument used here is that because this guy on the corner is being paid a couple of dollars to wear a Tshirt promoting a band or something, that he is **directly profiting** from his telling people where other people are. 


The main problem here is that computers can't tell "good" from "bad". If you teach them that the word "cocaine" is bad, they don't know that "coke" is bad. If you teach them that coke is then you're working your way down a rabbit hole of trying to block euphemisms as quickly as an entire community of "bad" guys creates them.
I find it pretty humorous that this communication is happening on a social media platform the police choose to engage with. They could just as easily not post to facebook. But no, taking away an inalienable human right makes way more sense.
>"I would like to remind everyone that this is a Police page and whatever your thoughts on one of my officers seizing drugs in the community, being insulting, abusive or offensive can and will result in a prosecution under the Malicious Communications Act 1988.


Gosh it would be an absolute *shame* if trolls on the internet from outside the UK started ridiculing the West Yorkshire Police's facebook page. 
If you want the actual story, don’t read this garbage, read [this article]( http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/black-activist-jailed-facebook-posts-slams-fbi-article-1.3984603) on it; it doesn’t skimp past the tinsy tiny little factoid that he founded (in its own words) an “organization to train pan-African youths in guerilla warfare to free them from the colonizers.” It’s nauseatingly stupid and don’t forget he was ~~found with illegally obtained firearms (illegal because of domestic assault he committed a few years back).~~ *arrested for, case thrown out by Texas gun laws*

Go see for yourself and remember to check before getting fooled by hack propaganda into supporting a demented racial supremacist.

Edit: and yes I understand people in this country get shit from the police just because of their skin color. Yes I understand it’s fucking absurd in this day and age. But by GOD do not prop this guy up as a martyr; there’s plenty of others to choose from.
Class Action lawsuits are not designed to get the parties of the class a windfall settlement.  It is to impose a financial penalty so severe that the company would think twice about their future actions.  Some have the capability to change entire industries (see chemical plants in the 70s and 80s) but most have no teeth (see bankcard transaction reordering suits). 

Or to put it simply, how much have you been damaged by facebook collecting texts and call logs?  Likely not much.  Maybe you could say that's valuable information they could sell.  Well how much is that?  $10.. maybe?  So what's $10 multiplied by the size of the class (let's estimate 100 million)?  $1 billion.  They turn $4.7B in profit per year.  

Basically what we are saying by signing on to a class action lawsuit is that they deserve to payout 1/4 of their profits because they don't deserve it.  Do the lawyers deserve it?  Hell of a lot more than Facebook does for doing this shit.

Alternatively you could sue Facebook yourself and instead of a $999,999,990 payment they have to make, I could end up winning a $5000 judgement meaning they have to pay more and I get more money.  The only way this wins is if *everyone* files suit, otherwise Facebook could respond with a lawyer and I could end up still winning but walking away with only court costs (read $0)

This is why I uninstalled the Facebook app years ago, and never installed the Messenger app. I use the touch.facebook.com website on my phone, because it can't track my phone usage or harvest data from my contacts or anything. It's just a passive website.
